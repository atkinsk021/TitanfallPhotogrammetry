# TitanfallPhotogrammetry
Photogrammetry project from 3D Assets module for Entertainment Systems module in WIT

Contains a Dense Cloud .obj file to be used as a model in Unreal Engine, Unity etc. 
From experience, best results occur within the Unity engine when importing the file.

Model was scanned into software from multiple images taken from a Galaxy S8. Object scanned was a figurine based on the game Titanfall 2.
Only the front of the object was scanned and was done so with 12 images of slight rotation.
